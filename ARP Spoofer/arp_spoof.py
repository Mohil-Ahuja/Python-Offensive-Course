# This script creates an ARP spoofing packet.
# The ARP packet is used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local area network.
# The ARP packet is used to tell the target machine that the router's ip address is associated with target's MAC address.
# The target machine will then send all its traffic to the attacker's machine instead of the router.
