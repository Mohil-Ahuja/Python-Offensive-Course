arp -a : to check arp table 

How this attack works?
By telling the victim , that your device has the router's IP and then telling the router, that you have the victim's ip so now the traffic between victim and router flows through you.

To enable the flow of device through your device, 
enable port forwarding 
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
