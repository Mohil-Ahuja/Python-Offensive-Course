First use arp spoofer to become the man in the middle , then you can use other scripts like dns_spoof, replacing downloads etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
use iptables to modify the route of the packets travelling through your device
The below command will help to form a queue of the packets travelling through your computer by another ip 
!iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0


but the below command will help to form a queue of the packets locally.
!iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
!iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

Ways to do DNS Spoofing:
Installing a DNS Server: setting up a DNS server for returning any website for DNS requests.

Crafting a DNS Response: This method involves manually creating DNS responses, which requires a deep understanding of DNS and is complex.

Modifying a Forwarded DNS Response: The most advanced method, which includes capturing and altering DNS responses from a legitimate server before sending them back to the user.



We will be doing the third one (its simpler, just change the ip)

to flush the iptables use 
iptables --flush 

------------------------------------------------------
To use beef with code injector 

replace the script to be injected 
------------------------------------------------------

For HTTPS websites 

we will do SSL Strip and downgrade it to http 
the man in the middle tool will downgrade the request coming 
from the server to http and then upgrade the http requests 
coming from the target machine so the web server can respond properly.

HSTS websites are not possible to bypass, because whatever we do try 
those websites are hardcoded into the computer to only load 
over https connection
