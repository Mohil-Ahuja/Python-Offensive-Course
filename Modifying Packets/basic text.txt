use iptables to modify the route of the packets travelling through your device
The below command will help to form a queue of the packets travelling through your computer by another ip 
!iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0


but the below command will help to form a queue of the packets locally.
!iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
!iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
